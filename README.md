#  Project Overview

The Planetary Detection AI is an intelligent machine learning system designed to identify the presence of exoplanets around stars based on astrophysical datasets.
Our mission: to give the brain to space telescopes, transforming the vast raw data from the cosmos into meaningful, interpretable planetary insights.

The AI uses:

XGBoost ‚Äî for precise and optimized binary classification.

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) ‚Äî to reduce bias and ensure balanced learning.

FastAPI ‚Äî to create a lightweight, interactive web interface.

Python ‚Äî as the core language for preprocessing, denoising, and model training.

# Technical Summary
Component	Description
Algorithm	XGBoost Classifier (Binary Classification)
Bias Reduction	SMOTE applied to resampled training data
Deployment Stack	FastAPI + Uvicorn + Pyngrok
Dataset Source	NASA & Kaggle (star datasets)
Training Data Size	~4 GB (sampled subset of larger astronomical datasets)
Goal	Identify presence (1) or absence (0) of planetary bodies
Output	Probability score of planet existence

# Workflow Overview

Data Collection:
Publicly available NASA and Kaggle datasets were used for stellar characteristics.

Preprocessing:

Missing values handled

Noise removed

Features normalized

Data merged across multiple files for consistency

Bias Correction:
SMOTE applied to achieve parity between classes (planet_present, planet_absent).

Model Training:
XGBoost classifier was trained on cleansed, resampled data.

Deployment (FastAPI):

Built a local API endpoint for inference

Created user-facing interface via FastAPI routes

Enabled public deployment using NGROK (FaaS demonstration-ready)

# Deployment Philosophy

This project was designed to run even on low-end machines, yet scaleable to quantum computing frameworks through Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) or serverless deployments.

FastAPI was chosen over Flask or Django because:

It‚Äôs asynchronous, hence more efficient for data inference.

It supports OpenAPI documentation natively.

It ensures easy integration with AI pipelines.

# Future Scope

Integrating real-time telescope data streams from NASA APIs

Adapting model for multi-class exoplanet classification

Hosting the model on serverless edge computing environments

Using quantum-inspired algorithms for hyperparameter optimization

# Conclusion

This project represents a confluence of astronomical science, machine learning precision, and open-source accessibility.
It empowers future researchers to explore the stars with intelligence ‚Äî one prediction at a time. üåå
